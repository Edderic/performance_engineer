scrape_bugsnag.rb
=================

- Bugsnag Errors API does not help us figure how many errors have changed over
  seven days, and this is why this file was made.

Installation
------------

- Have a `BUGSNAG_EMAIL` and `BUGSNAG_PASSWORD` variable in your environment (add it to your `.bash_profile`).
- Run via `ruby scrape_bugsnag.rb`
